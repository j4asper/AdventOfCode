# Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.  
You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

## My own solutions

This reporsitory is dedicated to my solutions of the different challenges. I usually solve some challenges when I am bored. The goal is to complete all the challenges from 2015 and up.  

All code in this repo is only tested in [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.10.X  

## How i typically solve the problems

I start by reading the whole thing, after that, read it again and look at the examples they have made. Typically there will be example data. I will put this data in my input.txt and try to code the way that the example is explained. With the code, i can directly see if my program matches the example data and the solution to those. If it does, then i will get the real puzzle input and run it again, hopefully it works. If not, debug your way out of it somehow. Have fun.  
It may help you to look at others solutions, but i would advise against that if you have some experience in programming. But if you solve the problem, go ahead and look at other and probably better solutions.
